# sentimental_analysis

Sentiment analysis is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. 
It’s often used to analyze opinions, reviews, or social media comments to understand the sentiment expressed (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral).

The sentimental_Analysis.ipynb file follows a typical workflow for performing sentiment analysis. Here's an overview of the workflow and methods used:

Workflow Overview:

Importing Libraries:
The notebook begins by importing essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and nltk. These libraries are commonly used for data manipulation, visualization, and natural language processing.

Loading the Data:
The data is loaded from a CSV file named Reviews.csv. Initially, the full dataset is loaded, which contains 568,454 rows and 10 columns. However, for simplicity, the notebook only works with the first 500 rows of data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The notebook likely includes steps to explore the data, such as visualizing the distribution of sentiments, checking for missing values, and understanding the structure of the data.

Text Preprocessing:
The text data is preprocessed using NLP techniques. This might involve tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and transforming the text into a format suitable for analysis.

Model Building:
The notebook probably builds a machine learning or deep learning model to classify sentiment. Common models used for sentiment analysis include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or neural networks like LSTMs or BERT.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations like confusion matrices may also be used to understand the model’s performance.

Conclusion:
The notebook may conclude with a summary of findings, including the model's effectiveness and potential areas for improvement.
